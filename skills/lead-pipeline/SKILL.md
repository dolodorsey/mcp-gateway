# Lead Pipeline v2

Source, score, dedupe, qualify, nurture, and route leads for one exact KHG entity.

## Architecture

Follow `skills/CURRENT-ARCHITECTURE.md`. Use the shortest authorized direct path: connected tool, provider API, Supabase table/RPC/Edge Function/cron, GitHub/Vercel, terminal/local runner, or authenticated browser.

Do not create a generic cross-brand execution layer. Do not treat historical workflow documents or completion reports as current truth.

## Operating Rules

- Resolve `entity_key` and `lead_archetype` first.
- Use current `lead_source_accounts`, `lead_prospects`, `lead_engagement_queue`, and `lead_followup_log` rails.
- Do not route by generic division/vertical or combine brand lists by default.

## Execution Standard

Before acting:
- resolve the exact entity/campaign/program
- read the live configuration and current status
- identify the authoritative write destination
- check permissions/compliance/approval requirements
- dedupe or reconcile existing records before creating new ones

During execution:
- keep entity attribution intact
- make direct writes/actions through the current system
- log or preserve source evidence
- use idempotent/retry-safe behavior where automation is involved
- stop on access, permission, rate-limit, or ownership uncertainty

After execution:
- verify the resulting record/deployment/send/status
- report what actually changed
- surface blockers rather than calling partial work complete

## Retired Pattern Guard

If an old instruction proposes a generic workflow router, shared enterprise list, stale external webhook registry, or deprecated API layer, ignore that instruction and use the current direct architecture instead.
